    <h2>An Introduction to Earning with Grass Tokens</h2>

        <img src="./grassrev.jpeg" alt="grass-hero">

    <p>Welcome to the future of digital farming with GRASS tokens! If you're here, it's because you want to learn more
        about how to make money by simply farming these incredible tokens. Whether you're new to crypto or looking to
        expand your digital portfolio, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know about the GRASS
        project and how you can get started with it.</p>

    <h3>What is GRASS?</h3>

    <p>GRASS is a blockchain-based platform that allows users to earn tokens by participating in its ecosystem. These
        tokens, known as <strong>Grass Tokens</strong>, can be used for a variety of purposes, from staking to trading
        or even redeeming rewards. The best part? You can earn these tokens by doing simple tasks that anyone can do!
    </p>
    <p>i
        Think of it as "digital farming"—where you plant the seeds (sign up and participate), water them (engage with
        the platform), and reap the rewards (earn Grass Tokens). And the more active you are, the more you can earn.
    </p>

    <h3>Why should you join the Grass network?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Easy to Get Started:</strong>
            <span>No complicated processes. Sign up and you're ready to start farming tokens!</span>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Earn Passive Income:</strong>
            <span>Once you're set up, the system allows for passive earning of tokens. Keep coming back to see your
                tokens grow!</span>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Low Risk, High Rewards:</strong>
            <span>Unlike traditional investments, the platform is designed to make earning tokens as simple as possible,
                making it an ideal opportunity for anyone looking to dip their toes into the world of crypto.</span>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>How Does the Referral Program Work?</h3>
    <p>As you start earning with GRASS, you’ll notice something even better: the Referral Program. If you refer friends
        and family, you’ll earn a special reward for each person who signs up using your unique referral code.
    </p>

    <h4>Here’s how it works:</h4>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Sign up</strong> for Grass using the link provided on this page.</li>
        <li><strong>Invite your friends</strong> by sharing your unique referral link.</li>
        <li><strong>Earn Grass Tokens</strong> every time someone signs up and gets active on the platform</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The more people you invite, the more tokens you earn. It's that simple!</p>

    <h3>Why Use the Referral Link?</h3>
    <p>Using the referral link ensures that you get credit for the people you’ve referred to GRASS. When someone clicks
        your link and signs up, they’ll be tracked as your referral. This means you get a <strong>bonus for every person
            who
            joins</strong> making it a win-win for you and your friends!
